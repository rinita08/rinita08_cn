1. An ISP is granted a block of addresses starting with 190.100.0.0/16. The ISP needs to 
distribute these addresses to three groups of customers as follows: i. The first group has 
64 customers; each needs 256 addresses. ii. The second group has 128 customers; each 
needs 128 addresses. iii. The third group has 128 customers; each needs 64 addresses. 
Here is a possible design for the address allocation using Variable Length Subnet Masking 
(VLSM). We will allocate the largest blocks first. 
Group 1 & 2 Calculation (same total size) 
● Group 1: 64 customers × 256 addresses/customer = 16,384 total addresses. 
● Group 2: 128 customers × 128 addresses/customer = 16,384 total addresses. To 
accommodate 16,384 addresses, we need a block size of 2^{14} (since 2^{14} = 16,384). 
This corresponds to a CIDR prefix of 32 - 14 = /18. 
Group 3 Calculation 
● Group 3: 128 customers × 64 addresses/customer = 8,192 total addresses. To 
accommodate 8,192 addresses, we need a block size of 2^{13} (since 2^{13} = 8,192). 
This corresponds to a CIDR prefix of 32 - 13 = /19. 
Address Allocation 
We start with the initial block: 190.100.0.0/16 (Range: 190.100.0.0 to 190.100.255.255). 
1. Allocation for Group 1 (/18 block): 
○ Subnet Address: 190.100.0.0/18 
○ Address Range: 190.100.0.0 to 190.100.63.255. This block provides 16,384 
addresses. 
2. Allocation for Group 2 (/18 block): 
○ The next available address is 190.100.64.0. 
○ Subnet Address: 190.100.64.0/18 
○ Address Range: 190.100.64.0 to 190.100.127.255. This block provides 16,384 
addresses. 
3. Allocation for Group 3 (/19 block): 
○ The next available address is 190.100.128.0. 
○ Subnet Address: 190.100.128.0/19 
○ Address Range: 190.100.128.0 to 190.100.159.255. This block provides 8,192 
addresses. 

Summary of Allocation: 
● Group 1: 190.100.0.0/18 
● Group 2: 190.100.64.0/18 
● Group 3: 190.100.128.0/19 




3. A supernet has a first address of 205.16.32.0 and a supernet mask of 255.255.248.0. 
State the number of blocks are in this supernet and what is the range of addresses? 
1. Find the CIDR Prefix: The supernet mask is 255.255.248.0. Let's convert this to binary: 
11111111.11111111.11111000.00000000 Counting the number of 1s gives the prefix: 8 + 8 + 5 = 
21. So, the mask is /21. 
2. Number of Blocks: The first address, 205.16.32.0, belongs to a Class C range (192-223). A 
standard Class C network has a /24 mask. The supernet mask is /21. The number of combined 
Class C blocks is calculated as: 2^{(\text{Class C prefix} - \text{Supernet prefix})} = 2^{(24 - 21)} 
= 2^3 = 8. So, there are 8 blocks of Class C networks in this supernet. 
3. Range of Addresses: 
● First Address (Network Address): 205.16.32.0 
● Calculate the total number of addresses: The host portion of the address is 32 - 21 = 
11 bits. The total number of addresses is 2^{11} = 2048. 
● Calculate the Last Address (Broadcast Address): 
○ The network address is 205.16.32.0. 
○ The last address is found by adding (Total Addresses - 1) to the first address. In the 
IP address, this means adding 2047 to the host part. 
○ The address range covers from 205.16.32.0 to 205.16.(32 + 7).255. 
○ The last octet will be 255. The third octet will be 32 + (2048 / 256 - 1) = 32 + 7 = 39. 
○ So, the last address is 205.16.39.255. 
● Address Range: The range of addresses is from 205.16.32.0 to 205.16.39.255. 
5. A company is granted the site address 201.70.64.0. The company needs six subnets 
design the subnets. 
1. Determine Bits to Borrow: 
● The given site address 201.70.64.0 is a Class C address, which has a default subnet 
mask of /24 (255.255.255.0). 
● The company needs six subnets. We need to find the number of bits (n) to borrow from 
the host part such that 2^n \ge 6. 
● If n=2, 2^2 = 4 (not enough). 
● If n=3, 2^3 = 8 (sufficient). 
● So, we need to borrow 3 bits. 
2. Calculate the New Subnet Mask: 
● The new subnet mask is the default mask plus the borrowed bits: 24 + 3 = /27. 
● In decimal, the mask is 255.255.255.224 (11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000). 
3. Calculate Subnet Details: 
● Number of addresses per subnet: The host part has 32 - 27 = 5 bits. So, each subnet 
has 2^5 = 32 addresses. 
● Block Size (Increment): The increment for each subnet is 32 in the fourth octet. 

4. Design the Subnets: Here are the first six subnets: 
● Subnet 1: 
○ Subnet Address: 201.70.64.0/27 
○ Range: 201.70.64.0 - 201.70.64.31 
● Subnet 2: 
○ Subnet Address: 201.70.64.32/27 
○ Range: 201.70.64.32 - 201.70.64.63 
● Subnet 3: 
○ Subnet Address: 201.70.64.64/27 
○ Range: 201.70.64.64 - 201.70.64.95 
● Subnet 4: 
○ Subnet Address: 201.70.64.96/27 
○ Range: 201.70.64.96 - 201.70.64.127 
● Subnet 5: 
○ Subnet Address: 201.70.64.128/27 
○ Range: 201.70.64.128 - 201.70.64.159 
● Subnet 6: 
○ Subnet Address: 201.70.64.160/27 
○ Range: 201.70.64.160 - 201.70.64.191 




6. Write down the subnet work number of a host with an IP address of 172.16.66.0/21? 
To find the subnet work number (also known as the subnet address or network ID), we perform 
a bitwise AND operation between the IP address and the subnet mask. 
1. IP Address: 172.16.66.0 
2. Subnet Mask: /21, which is 255.255.248.0 in decimal. 
Let's convert the third octet of both the IP and the mask to binary, as this is where the subnet 
boundary lies. 
● IP Address (172.16. 66 .0): 10101100.00010000.01000010.00000000 
● Subnet Mask (255.255. 248 .0): 11111111.11111111.11111000.00000000 
Now, perform the bitwise AND operation: 
10101100.00010000.01000010.00000000  (IP Address: 172.16.66.0) 
& 11111111.11111111.11111000.00000000  (Subnet Mask: 255.255.248.0) ------------------------------------- 
10101100.00010000.01000000.00000000  (Result) 
Finally, convert the resulting binary address back to decimal: 
● 10101100 = 172 
● 00010000 = 16 
● 01000000 = 64 
● 00000000 = 0 
The subnet work number is 172.16.64.0. 





7. You need to subnet a network that has 5 subnets, each with at least 16 hosts. State 
classful subnet mask would you use? 
Let's analyze the requirements: 
1. Host Requirement: At least 16 hosts per subnet. 
○ The formula for usable hosts is 2^h - 2, where h is the number of host bits. 
○ 2^h - 2 \ge 16 \implies 2^h \ge 18. 
○ 2^4 = 16 (not enough). 2^5 = 32 (sufficient). 
○ So, we need to reserve at least 5 bits for hosts. 
2. Subnet Requirement: 5 subnets. 
○ The formula for subnets is 2^s, where s is the number of subnet bits. 
○ 2^s \ge 5. 
○ 2^2 = 4 (not enough). 2^3 = 8 (sufficient). 
○ So, we need to borrow at least 3 bits for subnets. 
The most efficient classful network to use would be a Class C network. A Class C network has 
a default /24 mask, leaving 8 bits for hosts. 
● We need 3 bits for subnets and 5 bits for hosts. 
● Total bits needed from the host portion = 3 + 5 = 8. 
● This fits perfectly into the 8 host bits of a Class C address. 
Subnet Mask Calculation: 
● Start with the default Class C mask: /24 (255.255.255.0). 
● Borrow 3 bits for the subnets. 
● New subnet mask prefix: 24 + 3 = /27. 
● The /27 mask in decimal is 255.255.255.224. 
This mask creates 2^3 = 8 subnets, and each subnet has 2^5 = 32 addresses (30 usable hosts), 
satisfying both conditions. 





8. Your company has the network ID 165.121.0.0. You are responsible for creating 
subnets on the network, and each subnet must provide at least 900 host IDs. State the 
subnet mask which meets the requirement for the minimum number of host IDs and 
provides the greatest number of subnets? 
1. Identify Network Class: The network ID 165.121.0.0 is a Class B network, which has a 
default mask of /16 (255.255.0.0). 
2. Calculate Required Host Bits: 
○ Each subnet needs at least 900 host IDs. 
○ Using the formula 2^h - 2 \ge 900, where h is the number of host bits. 
○ 2^h \ge 902. 
○ 2^9 = 512 (too small). 
○ 2^{10} = 1024 (sufficient). 
○ So, we must reserve 10 bits for the host part. 
3. Determine the Subnet Mask: 
○ The total number of bits in an IPv4 address is 32. 
○ To get 10 host bits, the subnet mask must have 32 - 10 = 22 network bits. 
○ The CIDR prefix for the subnet mask is /22. 
4. Convert to Decimal Notation: 
○ A /22 mask in binary is 11111111.11111111.11111100.00000000. 
○ Converting this to decimal gives 255.255.252.0. 
This subnet mask (255.255.252.0 or /22) meets the requirement of at least 900 hosts (providing 
2^{10} - 2 = 1022 usable hosts) and maximizes the number of subnets because it uses the 
minimum possible number of host bits.


 
9. Write down the broadcast address on subnet 32 given a prefix notation of 12.1.0.0/12? 
1. Analyze the Prefix: The prefix is 12.1.0.0/12. 
○ Subnet Mask: /12, which is 255.240.0.0. 
○ The subnetting is done in the second octet. 
2. Determine the Subnet Range: 
○ The block size in the second octet is 256 - 240 = 16. 
○ This means the valid network addresses for the second octet are multiples of 16: 0, 
16, 32, 48, etc. 
3. Identify the Target Subnet: 
○ The question asks for "subnet 32", which refers to the subnet whose network 
address is 12.32.0.0/12. 
4. Calculate the Broadcast Address: 
○ The broadcast address is the last address in the subnet's range. To find it, we can 
find the next subnet's address and subtract one. 
○ The current subnet is 12. 32 .0.0. 
○ The next subnet would be 12. (32 + 16) .0.0 = 12.48.0.0. 
○ The broadcast address for the 12.32.0.0 subnet is the address just before 
12.48.0.0. 
○ Therefore, the broadcast address is 12.47.255.255. 



10. An organization is granted the blocks 130.56.0.0. The administrator wants to create 
1024 fixed length subnets. i. Find the subnet mask. ii. Find the number of addresses in 
each subnet. iii. Find the first and last addresses of the first subnet. iv. Find the first and 
last addresses of the last subnet. 
Initial Information: 
● Network Address: 130.56.0.0. This is a Class B address, so the default mask is /16. 
● Required Subnets: 1024. 
i. Find the subnet mask. 
● We need to find the number of bits (s) to borrow such that 2^s \ge 1024. 
● 2^{10} = 1024. So, we need to borrow 10 bits. 
● New prefix = Default prefix + borrowed bits = 16 + 10 = /26. 
● The subnet mask is /26, which in decimal is 255.255.255.192. 
ii. Find the number of addresses in each subnet. 
● The number of host bits (h) is 32 - \text{new prefix} = 32 - 26 = 6 bits. 
● The number of addresses per subnet is 2^h = 2^6 = 64. 
iii. Find the first and last addresses of the first subnet. 
● The first subnet is always the original network address with the new mask. 
● First Address (Network ID): 130.56.0.0 
● The subnet has 64 addresses, so the block size is 64. The range is 0-63 in the last octet. 
● Last Address (Broadcast ID): 130.56.0.63 
iv. Find the first and last addresses of the last subnet. 
● There are 1024 subnets in total (from subnet 0 to subnet 1023). 
● The borrowed bits are 10 (2 from the third octet and 8 from the fourth octet... wait, this is 
incorrect). The 16 host bits are in the 3rd and 4th octets. We borrow the first 10. This 
means we borrow all 8 bits from the third octet, and the first 2 bits from the fourth octet. 
● For the last subnet, all 10 borrowed bits will be '1'. 
● The third octet (8 bits) will be 11111111 = 255. 
● The first 2 bits of the fourth octet will be 11. 
● To find the network ID of this last subnet, we set the host bits to 0. The host bits are the 
last 6 bits of the fourth octet. 
● Fourth octet = 11000000 = 192. 
● So, the First Address (Network ID) of the last subnet is 130.56.255.192. 
● The block size is 64. The range is 192-255. 
● The Last Address (Broadcast ID) of the last subnet is 130.56.255.255. 
11. An organization is granted a block of addresses starting with 190.100.0.0/26. The 
organization needs to have four subnets. Write down the subnet addresses and the range 
of addresses for each subnets? 
1. Analyze the Existing Block: 
● The given block is 190.100.0.0/26. 
● The mask /26 means the current block size is 2^{(32-26)} = 2^6 = 64 addresses. 
● The range of this block is 190.100.0.0 to 190.100.0.63. 
2. Determine Bits to Borrow: 
● The organization needs four subnets from this block. 
● We need to find the number of bits (n) to borrow such that 2^n \ge 4. 
● 2^2 = 4. So, we need to borrow 2 more bits. 
3. Calculate the New Subnet Mask: 
● The new subnet mask prefix is the old prefix plus the borrowed bits: 26 + 2 = /28. 
● The new mask is 255.255.255.240. 
4. Calculate New Subnet Details: 
● Number of addresses per new subnet: 2^{(32-28)} = 2^4 = 16. 
● Block Size (Increment): The increment is 16 in the fourth octet. 

5. List the Subnets and Ranges: We will create four subnets of size 16 within the original 
190.100.0.0 - 190.100.0.63 range. 
● Subnet 1: 
○ Subnet Address: 190.100.0.0/28 
○ Range of Addresses: 190.100.0.0 - 190.100.0.15 
● Subnet 2: 
○ Subnet Address: 190.100.0.16/28 
○ Range of Addresses: 190.100.0.16 - 190.100.0.31 
● Subnet 3: 
○ Subnet Address: 190.100.0.32/28 
○ Range of Addresses: 190.100.0.32 - 190.100.0.47 
● Subnet 4: 
○ Subnet Address: 190.100.0.48/28 
○ Range of Addresses: 190.100.0.48 - 190.100.0.63
